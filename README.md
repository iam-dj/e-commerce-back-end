## Description
As a back-end e-commerce app, I provide various API routes for interacting with an e-commerce website's database. You can use my API routes to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags. Additionally, I can handle associations between these models, such as assigning tags to products or linking products to categories. I am built using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, and I can also handle user authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.
